// 🦴 pet_rig_config.js — the pet's skeleton
// ===========================================================
//
//  Every number here is in SOURCE-IMAGE pixels, i.e. coordinates inside
//  images/base.png (851 x 1134). The rig scales them to whatever size the pet
//  is drawn at, so changing the pet's drawn height changes nothing here.
//
//  ── THE ONE RULE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  The joints must sit where the joints ARE in your artwork. That is the whole
//  contract. Draw the pet with its arms straight out and the shoulders, elbows
//  and hands go on that line; draw it with its arms down and they go there
//  instead. The rig does not care which, and neither pose is more "correct" —
//  see restPose below.
//
//  Nothing else has to be re-measured when you change the art, because the rig
//  works out where each limb's pixels are for itself: a pixel belongs to
//  whichever bone it is nearest to. That is how the cuts used to be measured by
//  hand, so it produces the same result, but it now follows the skeleton
//  automatically instead of being a list of polygons that goes stale.
//
//  TO RE-TUNE: run the app and press Ctrl+Shift+B. The overlay draws every
//  joint, bone, derived cut, skin grid, soft-tissue patch and back-part chain on
//  top of the pet, so you can see exactly what you are changing. Or serve the
//  folder and open tools/rig_check.html, which shows the four poses that break a
//  rig side by side and will stress-test the numbers you have just changed.
// ===========================================================

    // The drawing has a shoulder bar, a spine, two arms, two legs and a little

    //                     within a pixel — so the bar is read as the collarbone
    //                     (it gives chest, and the width the shoulders brace
    //                     to) and the arm strokes give the pivots, because a
    //                     shoulder pivots where the arm leaves the body. That

  //   z       draw order, higher = in front
  //   grab    how close the cursor must be, in source pixels, to grab it
  //
  // There is deliberately no artwork rectangle or clip polygon here. The rig
  // derives both from the skeleton and the sprite's own alpha, by giving each
  // opaque pixel to the bone it is nearest to, so a cut can never disagree
  // with the pose. If you ever need to overrule that for one bone, add
  //   cut: { rect: [sx, sy, sw, sh], clip: [[x,y], ...] }
  // and the rig will use your polygon for that bone and keep deriving the rest.

  //           against. Only needed where the answer is not "the bone that ends
  //           where this one starts" — the legs, which start at the hips.
  //
  // The spine is TWO bones. One chest-to-pelvis plank cannot bend, and a body
  // that cannot bend at the waist is the single loudest tell that something is
  // a puppet: thrown, it stays board-straight and pivots only at the hips; sat
  // on the floor it folds at nothing. 'torso' keeps its name because everything
  // that hangs off the upper body — a cape, a pair of wings — names it.

  // Two rigid blocks, not one: a ribcage above the waist and a pelvis below it,

  // does it silently, because a brace is satisfied by the body staying stiff.

  //
  // TO ADD ONE: draw it on a transparent 851x1134 canvas, lined up with
  // base.png exactly as a piece of clothing would be, save it as the 'img'
  // named below, and refresh. There is no other step. A part whose PNG is
  // missing simply does not exist — every entry here is optional.
  //
  //   bone       which bone it is glued to; it inherits that bone's position
  //              and rotation, so it can never come loose
  //   anchor     the point it pivots about, in source pixels
  //   z          draw order against the body (torso is 100) and against the
  //              back-layer clothes
  //
  // Then pick ONE kind of movement:
  //
  //   segments: N   a CHAIN. The part is sliced into N strips along its length
  //                 and each strip gets its own simulated point, so it whips
  //                 when the pet is thrown and settles when it lands. This is
  //                 what a ponytail or a tail needs — a stiff plank that
  //                 rotates in one piece does not read as hair.
  //                 'stiffness' (0..1) is how hard it springs back to its rest
  //                 shape: low is loose and floaty, high is barely-there.
  //
  //   lag: 0..1     ONE piece that trails behind its bone's rotation and
  //                 springs back. Right for something stiff, like a wing, and
  //                 much cheaper. 'maxLag' caps the trail in degrees.
  //                 'flap: true' adds a slow flutter while the pet is airborne.
  //
  // ⚠ NEVER PAINT A BACK PART INTO base.png. The rig gives every pixel to the
  // bone nearest it, so anything spread across several bones at once gets shared
  // out between them — invisible standing still, and torn apart the moment the
  // pet is thrown. This character's cape used to be painted into the base sprite
  // and split along her legs for exactly that reason. It now lives in
  // images/cape.png and swings as one piece; images/base_original.png is the
  // untouched sprite the parts came out of, kept for reference.
  //

  // ---- The skin ------------------------------------------------------------
  // The rig cuts the pet into limbs, and a limb used to be drawn as one rigid
  // stamp: rotate the cut-out about its joint, draw it, done. That is a puppet
  // made of boards. Two boards meeting at an elbow can only scissor — one edge
  // slides over the other and the corner opens — because nothing in that picture
  // knows the two are the same arm.
  //
  // So every cut is laid out as a GRID of quads instead, and each corner of that
  // grid is carried by more than one bone at once, in proportion to how near
  // each bone is. Deep in the forearm that is 100% forearm. Over the elbow it is
  // roughly half forearm and half upper arm, and a corner pulled two ways ends
  // up between the two — which is a crease. Same rule gives a shoulder that
  // rolls, a hip that folds and a waist that creases instead of kinking.
  //
  //   cell       grid spacing in source pixels. Smaller bends more smoothly and
  //              costs more: the drawing work is one clip and one blit per quad,
  //              and halving this quadruples the number of quads. 30 puts about
  //              4 quads across a forearm, which is enough for the crease.
  //   bleed      how far past the NEAREST bone another one may still be and
  //              still get a share of a corner, in source pixels. This is what
  //              keeps a hand held near a hip from being tugged at by the thigh
  //              across the gap between them — and, set too wide, it is the
  //              thing that makes the pet feel like jelly. At 34 the OUTER EDGE
  //              of a forearm still took 11% of its movement from the upper
  //              arm, so the forearm bent along its own length: rubber hose, not
  //              a limb. Down here that is under 2%, and the crease at the elbow
  //              itself is untouched, because at the joint the two bones are
  //              equidistant however sharp the falloff is.
  //   sharpness  how quickly a bone's share falls away with distance. Higher
  //              makes joints crisper and limbs stiffer; lower spreads every
  //              bend out and eventually turns the pet to rubber.
  //   bones      most bones allowed to share one corner.
  //   seamBleed  screen pixels each quad's clip is grown by. Two triangles that
  //              share an edge each antialias their own half of it and the two
  //              halves do not add back up to one opaque line, so without this
  //              there is a faint lattice over the whole pet.
  //
  // Turn 'enabled' off and every bone goes back to the single rotate-and-blit.
  // That is the fastest the rig can draw and the only thing it loses is the
  // bending, so it is the right switch to reach for on a slow machine.

  // Each entry is one patch of the body. It sits at (x, y) in source pixels,
  // reaches 'radius' pixels around itself, and the mesh corners inside that

  //              or body, and it wants to be far smaller than it feels like it
  //              should: while the pet is being dragged the patch sits pegged
  //              at its cap the whole time, so what reads on screen is the CAP,

  //   stiffness  how hard it springs back. Together with 'damping' this sets the

  //   maxOffset  hard cap in source pixels. Nothing may travel further than
  //              this, whatever it is hit with — the backstop that keeps a big
  //              throw from tearing the mesh open, and, because a dragged patch
  //              lives against it, the number you actually see.

  //              without re-tuning its spring.

  // The list is optional and every entry in it is independent: delete one, or
  // the lot, and the pet simply moves as a skeleton with skin on it.
  // The damping on each is set against its own stiffness so that every patch
  // gives one soft bounce and stops — damping / (2 x sqrt(stiffness)) is about
  // 0.7 for the chest and nearer 1 further down, where flesh does not bounce so
  // much as arrive late. Change stiffness and change damping with it, or the
  // patch will either ring like a spring or stop dead.

  // as well and moving them with the chest.
