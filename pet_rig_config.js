// ===========================================================
// 🦴 pet_rig_config.js — the pet's skeleton
// ===========================================================
//
//  Every number here is in SOURCE-IMAGE pixels, i.e. coordinates inside
//  images/base.png (851 x 1134). The rig scales them to whatever size the pet
//  is drawn at, so changing the pet's drawn height changes nothing here.
//
//  ── THE ONE RULE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  The joints must sit where the joints ARE in your artwork. That is the whole
//  contract. Draw the pet with its arms straight out and the shoulders, elbows
//  and hands go on that line; draw it with its arms down and they go there
//  instead. The rig does not care which, and neither pose is more "correct" —
//  see restPose below.
//
//  Nothing else has to be re-measured when you change the art, because the rig
//  works out where each limb's pixels are for itself: a pixel belongs to
//  whichever bone it is nearest to. That is how the cuts used to be measured by
//  hand, so it produces the same result, but it now follows the skeleton
//  automatically instead of being a list of polygons that goes stale.
//
//  TO RE-TUNE: run the app and press Ctrl+Shift+B. The overlay draws every
//  joint, bone, derived cut and back-part chain on top of the pet, so you can
//  see exactly what you are changing.
// ===========================================================

  // ---- Back parts ----------------------------------------------------------
  // Everything that is part of the BODY but sits BEHIND it: wings, a tail, long
  // hair, a ponytail. These cannot live in base.png — they would be welded to
  // the torso, and cutting the base into limbs would tear them apart.
  //
  // TO ADD ONE: draw it on a transparent 851x1134 canvas, lined up with
  // base.png exactly as a piece of clothing would be, save it as the 'img'
  // named below, and refresh. There is no other step. A part whose PNG is
  // missing simply does not exist — every entry here is optional.
  //
  //   bone       which bone it is glued to; it inherits that bone's position
  //              and rotation, so it can never come loose
  //   anchor     the point it pivots about, in source pixels
  //   z          draw order against the body (torso is 100) and against the
  //              back-layer clothes
  //
  // Then pick ONE kind of movement:
  //
  //   segments: N   a CHAIN. The part is sliced into N strips along its length
  //                 and each strip gets its own simulated point, so it whips
  //                 when the pet is thrown and settles when it lands. This is
  //                 what a ponytail or a tail needs — a stiff plank that
  //                 rotates in one piece does not read as hair.
  //                 'stiffness' (0..1) is how hard it springs back to its rest
  //                 shape: low is loose and floaty, high is barely-there.
  //
  //   lag: 0..1     ONE piece that trails behind its bone's rotation and
  //                 springs back. Right for something stiff, like a wing, and
  //                 much cheaper. 'maxLag' caps the trail in degrees.
  //                 'flap: true' adds a slow flutter while the pet is airborne.
  //
  // ⚠ NEVER PAINT A BACK PART INTO base.png. The rig gives every pixel to the
  // bone nearest it, so anything spread across several bones at once gets shared
  // out between them — invisible standing still, and torn apart the moment the
  // pet is thrown. This character's cape used to be painted into the base sprite
  // and split along her legs for exactly that reason. It now lives in
  // images/cape.png and swings as one piece; images/base_original.png is the
  // untouched sprite the parts came out of, kept for reference.
  //
  // The test for whether something needs its own file: if the pet moved an arm,
  // would this move WITH the arm, or stay put? A sleeve moves with the arm and
  // belongs in base.png. A cape does not, and needs its own file.
